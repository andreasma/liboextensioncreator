LibreOffice Extension Creator
=============================

The LibreOffice extension creator makes it more easy to create a non-code extension for LibreOffice. It provides an input form for the data for an extension with proper license information. The GUI/form is created by PyQt. It currently holds all fields to create a sceleton of a non-code LibreOffice extension.

The PyQt program will be updated regularly with new features to add languages and the features to create complete non-code LibreOffice extensions.
